The website I perhaps enjoyed most was probably this [Water Simulation](https://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/) I found while looking around. While other WebGL experiments I found may have been more technically impressive, this one was probably one of the first that I looked at and was genuinely awestruck, so it kinda stuck with me as I looked at others. The movement of the water is just super realistic and you can clearly see the waves you generate bouncing off of the walls. They even included the light refraction through the water and the ability ot alter the light source, which is just very cool to see. I had no idea that WebGL was this powerful, but the fact it can do this kind of thing really opens my mind to the possibilities.

Other WebGL experiments I found quite appealing:
