 
# Description: 
I think I could fairly easily implement the idea we discussed last week after class. That is, create a planetary viewer in Three JS. This project would allow you to pull up various planets and rotate them like a globe. I could have various images of the planets that get mapped onto a sphere and you can rotate them with input from the keyboard. There is also a lot of potential to do quality of life improvements like adding a starry background behind the planet, setting the sun as a light source off in the background, adding features from specific planets like Saturns rings or Neptune's many moons, even implementing maps of various planets from fiction just for the fun of it.
